# discordbot1.0.0
Discord bot made using Discord's OpenAPI for python (discord.py).
 
First time using an API for something "useful". Experienced some hiccups with trying to do cooler stuff with it, as a lot of features rely on Python concepts beyond my scope of knowledege and understanding.

Basic features: 

## -Client connection indicator<br>-Server logging<br>-Bot commands/automatic messages triggered upon input

Additionally, I referenced various useful links in the YAML file. They include Discord's developer portal, discord.py official documentation, Hikari's (discord.py API wrapper) GitHub page, and its respective official documentation site.
